            1. About the Prohibited and Restricted Products Policy
          </Text>
          <Text>
            1.1. Purpose
            YooKatale works hard to ensure that we keep our buyers’ trust and protect them against
            the sale of unsafe, illegal and otherwise unlicensed products when they shop on our
            marketplace.
            The purpose of this Prohibited and Restricted Products Policy is to support our sellers
            to work with us to ensure that there is no place for illegal products on YooKatale.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            1.2. Scope
            Prohibited products are those products that may never be sold on YooKatale due to
            illegality, whilst restricted products may only be sold if certain criteria are met.
            This Policy sets out:
          </Text>
          <Text className="pl-4">
            ● products that are prohibited from sale on YooKatale or subject to restrictions;

          </Text>
          <Text>
            2.1. Prohibited products
            Prohibited products are banned from sale on YooKatale . Specific prohibited products will
            vary by market, due to different local legal requirements. However, the following
            categories of products are always prohibited from sale on YooKatale:
          </Text>
          <Text className="pl-4">

          <Text className="pl-4">
            ● counterfeit products, as further outlined in the Anti-Counterfeit Policy
          </Text>
          <Text>
            2.2. Restricted products
            Restricted products are subject to local licensing and other requirements. Specific
            restricted products will also vary by market, but could include the following:
          </Text>
          <Text>
            ● Products (brands/categories) that are at high risk of counterfeit, and require
            authentication in order to distribute or sell.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            ● Products that require a license for import; and
          </Text>
          <Text>
           ● Products that require local registrations/permits from the relevant food and
            drugs agency (“FDA”) e.g. foods , alcohol, cosmetics and tobacco.
            YooKatale understands and prioritizes the regulation on food and drug categories that
            require permits for the exportation, importation, manufacture, and the
            registration of products such as drugs, chemicals, consumable goods, cosmetics,
            biological, and medical services which are produced in or outside Uganda.
            YooKatale requires that products that are listed and sold in these categories have
            valid registrations and this is a requirement for all products being listed in such
            categories. All listings of FDA regulated product categories are limited to local
            sellers and YooKatale managed accounts only.

            YooKatale may update the List from time to time, in order to stay current with available
            information and changes in the law.
            The List presents a helpful guide for sellers, but it is not exhaustive, and we rely on
            sellers to take full responsibility for exercising good judgment in respect of their
            product listings and ensuring that their products comply with the laws and regulations

           3. How does YooKatale detect prohibited and restricted products?
           YooKatale is continuously innovating to improve the ways we detect and prevent the sale
           of prohibited products, and monitor the sale of restricted products on our
           marketplace.
           YooKatale may detect a prohibited or restricted product in the following ways:
          </Text>
          <Text className="pl-4">
            ● Product creation: All listings of FDA regulated product categories are limited to
             local sellers and YooKatale managed accounts only. The listing includes a mandatory
             field for insertion of the FDA registration number.
          </Text>
          <Text className="pl-4">
           ● Product approval: When sellers create new product listings, the listings will be
             subject to approval by YooKatale before they are published on the website. Sellers
             will receive notification of all prohibited or restricted products that are blocked.
          </Text>
          <Text className="pl-4">
            ● Product content updates: Edits to listings are be subject to approval by YooKatale 
             before they are published on the website. Sellers will receive notification of all
             edits that are rejected.
          </Text>
          <Text className="pl-4">
            ● Physical inspection: We conduct random physical inspection of products in our
            possession, as well as more targeted inspections in respect of high risk products
            and sellers with high rates of return. We can therefore detect practices such as
            listing authentic products but delivering counterfeits, and the listing of counterfeit
            products under alternative brand names.
          </Text>
          <Text className="pl-4">
            ● Reports: We encourage all buyers, brands and manufacturers who have
             concerns about the sale of Prohibited and Restricted products to notify us as
             provided below. We will promptly investigate and take appropriate action to
             protect buyers, other sellers, and rights holders.

          <Text>
            4. What are the consequences of violation of this Policy?
            If a seller lists a prohibited or restricted product in violation this Policy and the law,
            YooKatale shall delist the products from sales and apply the appropriate financial
            penalties, as provided by the Penalty Policy.
            YooKatale may also, in its discretion, take further corrective action, which may include,
            without limitation, the following:
          </Text>
          <Text className="pl-4">
           ● arranging immediate collection by the seller of any stock in our possession;
